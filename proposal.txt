516 Project Proposal: MacKenzie Novotny

I will be doing some corpus processing of a French lexical database. The database I have located 
allows me to download files in a variety of formats. It has lexical and orthographical 
information, as well as a unique pronunciation guide for each word. This database also includes 
frequency information and syllable structures for each word. The literature for the database gives 
information about the phonemic system, which uses capital letters and symbols instead of 
traditional IPA symbols to circumvent encoding errors and allow the data to be read into multiple 
different file formats. The words are taken from a corpus of movie subtitles, and frequencies are 
relative to the corpus. This is not the ideal corpus for future linguistic research, but it will be an 
excellent starting point for a future French pronunciation training system. 

My final goal is to extract sets of minimal pairs of the structure CVC where the vowel defines 
the minimal pair. To do this, I will first have to put the text into a JavaScript readable format. 
Next, I can identify the words with the structure CVC. Of these words, I want an output of word 
sets that differ only by the medial vowel sound. Ideally, these are saved in a JSON file as an 
object. This will require regular expressions, loops, and the use of node.js among other 
knowledge I have gained from this class and elsewhere. I recognize that this is an ambitious 
project, but I hope I can at least do a small portion before the end of the semester.
